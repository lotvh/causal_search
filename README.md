## Objective
This is an algorithm which uses causal interference on a dataset consisting of
common KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in order to predict what caused
a significant change in the performance of a business.

## Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

- experience
- education
- nationality
